draft-one
=========

<p class="column">
  		Designed specifically to make you just keep moving forward when working
			on <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a>
			&mdash; though you can use it any time, of course &mdash;
			<strong>DraftOne</strong> gives you a quiet space in which to write but gently hassles you if
			your fingers stop typing.
			<br /><br />
			DraftOne was inspired by <a href="http://writeordie.com/#Web+App" target="_blank">Dr. Wicked's Write or Die!</a>,
			which helped me out tremendously during NaNoWriMo 2008.
			I owe him a debt of gratitude for helping me get that thing done, and I hope that DraftOne can help you
			get your own projects finished!
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			Under the <strong>Settings</strong> menu, you can set a goal for yourself &mdash; either a target number of minutes or number of
			words. Once you hit that goal, <strong>DraftOne</strong> will happily let you know that you've succeeded!
			And if you need the extra help, you can even <em>turn off the backspace key</em> so that you have no choice
			but to keep moving ahead.
		</p>
		<p class="clear center emphasis">
			It's not about perfection &mdash; it's about getting that first draft <em>done</em>.
