# Draft One (Though Really It's More Like Four)

Designed specifically to make you just keep moving forward when working on <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a> &mdash; though you can use it any time, of course &mdash; __DraftOne__ gives you a quiet space in which to write but gently hassles you if your fingers stop typing.

DraftOne was inspired by <a href="http://writeordie.com/#Web+App" target="_blank">Dr. Wicked's Write or Die!</a>, which helped me out tremendously way back during NaNoWriMo _2008_. I owe him a debt of gratitude for helping me get that thing done, and I hope that DraftOne can help you get your own projects finished!

Under the __Settings__ menu, you can set a goal for yourself &mdash; either a target number of minutes or number of words. Once you hit that goal, __DraftOne__ will happily let you know that you've succeeded! And if you need the extra help, you can even _turn off the backspace key_ so that you have no choice but to keep moving ahead.

It's not about perfection &mdash; it's about getting that first draft _done_.
